# Welcome to MetricsCollector!

MetricsCollector interacts with the kernel of a Windows, Mac, or Linux operating system and returns several useful metrics to the user.  This application provides the user with information about the following system metrics:

* Static metrics
* CPU
* Memory
* Network
* Power
* Process Info
* Sensors

### Prerequisites
* Java Virtual Machine

### Installing

MetricsCollector is very easy to install. Simply download the jar file from [here] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r6Y6kXuzJKM1JHFgEcjQ6OCHv6jitklV?usp=sharing), or save it on a thumb drive.
When you open it on your machine, it will install and open to the welcome page. From there you can choose which category of metrics you want to display.
